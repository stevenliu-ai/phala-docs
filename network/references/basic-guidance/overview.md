## How to Acquire PHA Tokens on Uniswap

### Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet installed in your browser such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Trust Wallet.
- Sufficient Ethereum (ETH) in your wallet to cover the swap amount and gas fees.
- Basic familiarity with using decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet to Uniswap

1. Open your browser and go to the official Uniswap interface at [https://app.uniswap.org](https://app.uniswap.org/).
2. Click on **Connect Wallet** in the upper right corner.
3. Select your wallet provider from the available options.
4. Approve the connection request in your wallet.

### Step 2: Locate the PHA Token Contract

PHA is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. To avoid fake tokens, make sure to use the official contract address:

- **Official PHA contract address:** `0x9e...` (Make sure to verify this on Phalaâ€™s official website or trusted sources.)

In Uniswap:

1. In the **Swap** interface, click on the token selector.
2. Paste the official PHA contract address into the search bar.
3. Select the PHA token once it appears.

### Step 3: Enter the Swap Details

1. In the **From** field, enter the amount of ETH (or other supported tokens) you want to swap.
2. In the **To** field, the amount of PHA tokens will auto-populate based on the current rate.
3. Review the estimated gas fees displayed below.

### Step 4: Execute the Swap

1. Click **Swap** to proceed.
2. A confirmation window will appear showing the swap details and gas fees.
3. Confirm the swap in your wallet.
4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Step 5: Add PHA Token to Your Wallet (Optional)

After the swap completes, you may need to manually add the PHA token to your wallet to see your balance:

1. In your wallet, find the **Add Token** or **Import Token** option.
2. Paste the official PHA contract address.
3. Add the token to view your PHA balance.

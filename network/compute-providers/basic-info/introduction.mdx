description: Essential information for becoming a compute provider on Phala Network(ETH L2).
title: Introduction
---

After [Sunsetting Phala Parachain and Migrating to Ethereum L2](https://phala.subsquare.io/democracy/referenda/77), and upgrading the network infrastructure to Intel TDX and GPU Confidential Computing, computing power providers will migrate from the parachain-based environment to the new Ethereum L2 ecosystem.

During this upgrade phase, existing miners running on Intel SGX technology will continue to operate to ensure network stability and continuity until full transition to TDX/GPU is achieved.

Following the sunsetting of the Phala parachain (expected on November 20, 2025), all confidential computing, staking, and governance activities will be consolidated on Ethereum L1 + L2. Phala’s confidential computing network will upgrade from Intel SGX–based infrastructure to next-generation technologies built on Intel TDX and GPU Confidential Compute.



**Existing Miners**

To ensure network stability and continuous operation throughout the transition period, existing miners on SGX-based infrastructure will continue operating until the full transition. The current SGX-based miners, though running on technology reaching its end-of-life, continue to provide essential compute power that helps avoid service disruptions and protects user assets until the new mining functionality is fully operational.



**An overview for this upgrade**

1. **Community Decision & Announcement (September 26 – October 15, 2025):**
   Community vote and publication of migration timelines, FAQs, and guides.

2. **Development and Exchange Preparation (October 15 – November 20, 2025):**
   Finalizing Ethereum L1 staking contracts, vPHA issuance, asset migration tools, and coordination with exchanges to disable parachain deposit/withdraw support.

3. **Phala Parachain Sunset (November 20, 2025):**
   Shutdown of parachain collators and infrastructure, asset freeze period begins.

4. **L2 Activation and Asset Migration (November 20 – 25, 2025):**
   Phala L2 becomes the primary platform for mining, staking, and governance. Users claim assets and delegations transition to the new vPHA model.

5. **Governance Migration (November 26 – 30, 2025):**
   Treasury and governance functions shift fully to Ethereum L1 with Snapshot and Safe multisig.

6. **Long-Term Roadmap:**
   Launch of new GPU/TDX mining models on L2 with rewards in vPHA, introduction of usage-based settlement models, and expansion of confidential compute services.

   

The new mining capabilities leveraging Intel TDX and GPU Confidential Computing are designed to deliver enhanced performance, improved security, and greater scalability aligned with enterprise needs and future growth. This represents a significant technical upgrade from the SGX model, enabling Phala Network to support more complex and resource-intensive confidential workloads.

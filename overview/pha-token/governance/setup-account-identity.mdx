title: Setting Up an Account Identity
---

After fully migration to Ethereum, Phala no longer uses the Substrate-based on-chain identity pallet that required users to reserve locked funds (`identity_reserve_funds` and per-field deposits) on-chain for storing identity details.

Instead, identity management on Phala now leverages Ethereum-native decentralized identity (DID) standards and frameworks such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service), ERC-725/735, or comparable solutions deployed as smart contracts on Ethereum.

More details will be announced in the near future.

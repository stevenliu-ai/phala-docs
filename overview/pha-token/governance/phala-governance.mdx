title: Phala Governance
---

Phala Network governance and treasury management have fully transitioned to operate on the Ethereum mainnet (L1). Governance decisions are executed through a decentralized and transparent process using Snapshot as the community voting platform combined with Safe multisignature wallets for secure treasury control and execution. The governance utility token, vPHA, empowers staking participants and miners with full voting rights, enabling active participation in protocol upgrades, fund allocation, and communityproposals.

## Council <a href="#council" id="council"></a>

Before migrating to Ethereum L1, Phala’s governance council operated on the Polkadot parachain framework, overseeing proposal assessment and network management. Currently, the council remains active, facilitating key decisions and overseeing network upgrades. With the migration, the council’s functions are gradually integrated into the Snapshot + Safe governance framework, evolving towards a more open, community-driven structure defined by ongoing governance votes and elections.
